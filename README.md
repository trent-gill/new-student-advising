## Welcome to New Student Advising!

Welcome to Brandon University!  We look forward to meeting you in person and helping you become a successful student. The advising process for new students is designed to introduce you to the educational experience at Brandon University. Students will be able to register for courses after working with advisors who will:

* Help you to learn how to access and use Moodle, BUâ€™s learning management system
* Help you learn how to use the Student Information Portal where you can see your final grades in courses, generate and print a timetable with your class times and locations, and access your financial statement(s).

This advising information on this webpage is designed for new students who are admitted into the following degree programs:

* Bachelor of Arts (BA) 
* Bachelor of Science (BSc)

## Step 4: Make an Appointment or Advise Yourself

To make an appointment, choose one of the following options:

**OPTION 1**: [Book an in-person appointment at Brandon University with an Academic Advisor](https://brandonu-ca-student-services.libcal.com/appointments){:target="_blank"}.

**OPTION 2**: [Book a phone or chat appointment at Brandon University with an Academic Advisor](https://brandonu-ca-student-services.libcal.com/appointments){:target="_blank"}.

**OPTION 3**: [Advise yourself and check-in with an advisor through email](https://goo.gl/forms/bUM8uE04egpXf9VD3){:target="_blank"}.

## Step 5: Check Your Email for Further Instructions

If you made an appointment, you will get a confirmation email from Student Services confirming the details of your appointment. Please show up on time and be prepared for your advising appointment. We recommend browsing the [Course Registration Guide](http://brandonu.ca/registration){:target="_blank"} and [Academic Calendar](http://brandonu.ca/calendar){:target="_blank"} so you can have an idea of what courses are available and what you might want to take. Please bring your BU ID and password to your appointment so an advisor can walk you through the registration.

If you submitted your course information through the self-advising form, an advisor at Brandon University will be in contact with you within 3 business days. 

## Step 6: [Register Using the Online Registration System](https://liszt.brandonu.ca/BUOnline/BUStart/Logon.aspx){:target="_blank"}

After your advising appointment, an academic advisor will lift your registration hold. They may walk you through the online registration process at the end of the appointment if there's time. If you have to register on your own, follow the link above in order to register for courses.

Students who are advising themselves will be able to use the registration system once an advisor has lifted your hold. An advisor will not lift your hold until you have completed the Self-Advising Form linked above and demonstrated that you understand the course selection process. 

Use your BU user ID and password that you claimed earlier to login to the online registration system. If you need help, revisit the [tutorial video on using the online registration system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AFAlXDHGQ8&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}. 

{% include warning.html content="Students will not be able to register until an academic advisor has lifted the registration hold. If you are still unable to register, contact your academic advisor from Step 5." %}

Your registration is only complete once you receive a tracking number and a confirmation email to your BU student email. Once you are registered, you can also confirm your registration by logging into the [Student Information Portal](https://webapp.brandonu.ca/pls/student/f?p=101:101){:target="_blank"}. 

If you are on a waiting list, you will be notified at your [BU email](https://webmail.brandonu.ca/){:target="_blank"} when a spot is available in the course.
